    <p>
        Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph. It starts with a single vertex and grows the MST by repeatedly adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it, until all vertices are included. This ensures the total weight of the tree is minimized without forming any cycles.
